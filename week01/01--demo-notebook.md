Math087 - Mathematical Modeling
===============================

Course material (Week 1): "Demo" notebook
-----------------------------------------


This notebook is intended to illustrate some features of [**jupyter** notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

For the most part, materials for this course will be presented in the form of notebooks like this one.

You can view notebooks on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) or
you can install some software on your own computer and view/edit notebooks there; there is discussion of installation on the [course web site](https://gmcninch-tufts.github.io/math87-fall2020/) -- in particular, the ["python & jupyter resources information"](https://gmcninch-tufts.github.io/math87-fall2020/course-info/03e-resources--python-and-jupyter.html) page.

Mathematical typesetting
-------------------------

Jupyter notebooks contain text (like this) but also they can contain *mathematical symbols*; for example:
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \begin{bmatrix} \alpha & \beta \\ \gamma & \delta \end{bmatrix}$$

If you are interested in what is going on "under the hood", text is entered using ``markdown`` syntax which is converted to ``html`` and displayed in your browser. 

Markdown and MathJax
---------------------

You can see the ``markdown`` underlying what you are reading now by "double clicking" 

You can read about [markdown syntax starting from here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
though there shouldn't be a need for you to write markdown for our course.

The mathematical typeset appears thanks to an *extension* to markdown/html called [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/); again, you don't really need to know details about mathjax. But
it is worth knowing that the syntax is the same as ``LaTeX``.

Under the hood?
----------------

If you are *curious*, you can see the markdown/mathjax that was used to create the text you are reading currently.

First, notice that there is a "boxed region" containing this text - in the parlance of ``jupyter`` notebooks, that region is called a ``cell``. If you click with the mouse pointer on this text, that ``cell`` receives ``focus``.

Now that you've focussed on this cell, you can get at the underlying ``code`` in a couple of ways:

- probably the simplest is to just double-click with the mouse inside the cell.
  In order to return to normal viewing, press shift-[enter]
  
- in ``colab``, you can click the right-hand mouse button to get a menu of options - then choose "Edit"

- in ``jupyter`` lab/notebook, there are some key sequences that enable editing, but I think I won't go into those details for now. "double-click" should always work...


Code!
-----

More importantly, ``jupyter`` permits you to view and evaluate ``code``. For this course, we'll always use code in the ``python`` (specifically: ``python3``) language, but other possibilities are available.

Remember the ``cells`` that we mentioned above? Well, there are a few types of cells. One is called a ``markdown`` cell, and such cells contain text (and mathematics) for reading. Another is called a ``code cell``, and it contains (in this case) ``python`` code.

The next cell is an example of a ``code cell``.


```python
from math import sin,cos

def g(x):
    return sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2

for i in range(10):
    print(f"{i} - {g(i):.5f}")
    
```

To execute the contents of a  ``code cell``, type [shift]-[enter] while that cell has the focus.
If the code in the cell produced ``output``, code execution will result in a new cell containing that output.

```python

```
