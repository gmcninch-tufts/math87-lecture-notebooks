    "\n",
    "For $n \\ge 19$, recall that\n",
    "$$C_{tot}(n) = C_{crew}(n) = \\dfrac{a}{n+1} + \\dfrac{b\\cdot n}{n+1} + cn$$\n",
    "for constants $a,b,c$ given by $a = 500\\cdot 280$, $b = 800 \\cdot 280$ and $c = 18000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating in $n$, find that\n",
    "$$(\\clubsuit) \\quad \\dfrac{dC_{tot}}{dn} = c + \\dfrac{b}{(n+1)^2} - \\dfrac{a}{(n+1)^2}$$\n",
    "since $\\dfrac{d}{dn}\\left[\\dfrac{n}{n+1} \\right] = \\dfrac{1}{(1+n)^2} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n \\ge 19$ notice that:\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{a}{(n+1)^2} \\le \\dfrac{a}{20^2} = 350.$$\n",
    "Since $b$ is non-negative, we see:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c + \\dfrac{b}{n+1} - \\dfrac{a}{(n+1)^2} \\ge c - 350 >0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms - as the above graph suggests -- that $C_{tot}$ is increasing for $n \\ge 19$. Thus for $n$ in $[19,\\infty)$ the minimal costs are located at the endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to find the minimum value of the cost function $C_{\\text{tot}}$ it is enough to find the minimum value for $n$ in the interval $[0,19]$.\n",
